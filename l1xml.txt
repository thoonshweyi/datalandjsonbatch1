=>XML (eXtensible Markup Language)

eXtensible = Exten our notation
Markup = Write using Markup
Language = Create your own document

XML VS HTML
XML is not all the same HTML. But both are Markup Language
XML is used to describe the data. HTML is used to display the data
XML must define custom rules (tags). HTML has pre-define rules (tags)

Need to enclose name of key within double quotes (should not use single quotes)


eg.element
<markup>Something Here</markup>

eg.attribute
<markup title="info">Something Here</markup>

eg.attribute

XML document = Describe Data (XML designed to describe data and to focus on what data is)
HTML document = Display Data (HTML was designed to display data and focus on how data look)
