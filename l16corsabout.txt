=>CORS 

Cross-origin Resource Sharing

- CROSS is a mechanism for integrating applications
- CROS defines are loaded in one domain to interest with different domain
- CROS allows client browser to check with third-party servers (if request auth / before data transfers)
- To protect cross-site request forgery (csrf)

= Same-origin policy

URL                                                    Outcome                  Reason
http://dltbank.com/transfer/create.html                Same Origin 
http://dltbank.com/transfer/report/check.html          Same Origin              Only path different
http://mm.dltbank.com/transfer/report/check.html       Different Origin         Different Protocol
http://mm.dltbank.com:81/transfer/report/check.html    Different Origin         Different port (http:// is port 80 by default)
http://news.dltbank.com:81/article.html                Different Origin         Different host

Same-origin policy is highly secure but inflexible for genius use cases.
-CORS is an extension of the same-origin policy
You need CORS when you to pull data from external APIs that are public or authorized or (authorized third-party access to your own server resources)
